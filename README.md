## Project Management
The project follows structured planning and agile methodologies for development.

## Architecture
The application follows a microservices-based architecture where:
- The backend is developed using FastAPI, ensuring high performance.
- MongoDB is used as the database to store trail data.
- The frontend is a Flutter application that interacts with the backend via API.

## Server Setup
### Nginx
Nginx serves as a reverse proxy, handling incoming requests efficiently.

### Firewall
A firewall is configured to secure the server and prevent unauthorized access.

## Backend (FastAPI)
FastAPI is used to handle API requests efficiently.

### Gunicorn
Gunicorn is used as a process manager for running multiple worker processes.

### Uvicorn
Uvicorn is employed as the ASGI server to handle asynchronous requests.

## Database (MongoDB)
MongoDB is used for storing trail data.

### Big Data Techniques
The project leverages MongoDB's capabilities to handle large datasets efficiently.

### Design Patterns
